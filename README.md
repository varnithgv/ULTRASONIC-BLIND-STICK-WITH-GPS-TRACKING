# ULTRASONIC-BLIND-STICK-WITH-GPS-TRACKING
 The Blindness is frequently used to describe severe visual impairments with or without residual vision. The application of ultrasonic ranging scheme for producing electronic walking stick for the blind is a technological advancement. There is a great dependency for any type of movement or walking within area or out of the particular area, they use only their natural senses such as touch or sound for identification or walking . To overcome all these problems of blind people, we are developing a project by using simple available technologies. This walking stick for blind people has multiple sensors, with the help of which it has been possible to enhance more features to the walking stick. The features include  detection of the obstacle for collision avoidance ,sending of  live location details over cloud for the caretaker to view which ensures safety for the blind. A SOS button for the blind which will alert the caretaker.
